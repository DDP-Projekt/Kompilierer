# The <ins>K</ins>ompilierer <ins>D</ins>er <ins>D</ins>eutschen <ins>P</ins>rogrammiersprache (Compiler for the german programming language)

"Die Deutsche Programmiersprache" (DDP) is a (joke-)programming language by NotLe0n and bafto, which was designed so that programs written in it read like (almost) proper german.

The documentation is a great starting point to learn DDP. There you will find a installation guide too.
